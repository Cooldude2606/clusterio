-- The following helper function is desync safe and avoids conflicts if called during on_server_startup
-- There are edge cases in the following events: pre player left, player left, console command, config changed
-- If you use any of these events and access globalData then make sure to call this function first

--- Public methods should be available though your top level module table
function MyModule.foo()
	game.print("foo")
end

--- Private methods should be local to the file, this will prevent others from calling it
local function bar()

	game.print(game.table_to_json(event))

	clusterio_api.send_json("__plugin_name__-plugin_example_ipc", {
		tick = game.tick, player_name = game.get_player(event.player_index).name

--- Nth tick is a special case that requires its own table, the index represents the time period between calls in ticks
MyModule.on_nth_tick[300] = function()
	game.print(game.tick)
	bar()
end

--- Always return the top level module table from control, this is how clusterio will access your event handlers
